# Project Status & Next Steps

## What We Have Accomplished So Far

We have completed all the difficult and necessary setup for the project. All the foundational work is now done.

1.  **Facebook App Created:** We successfully created a **Facebook Developer App** named "Vocabulary Page Bot".

2.  **Permissions Configured:** After many challenges with Facebook's tools, we successfully configured the app with the correct permissions (`pages_manage_posts` and `pages_show_list`) to allow it to post content.

3.  **Credentials Generated:** We navigated the complex developer dashboard to successfully generate the two most important secrets we need:
    *   A permanent **Page Access Token**.
    *   Your unique **Page ID**.

4.  **Google Sheets API Ready:** We have the credentials from your Google Cloud project, which will allow our script to read the vocabulary words from your spreadsheet.

5.  **Code Written:** I have written the complete Python script (`main.py`) that contains all the logic for the bot, and the `requirements.txt` file that lists its dependencies.

**In short: All setup is 100% complete. The project is built and ready for its first test run.**

## Our First and Only Remaining Task: The First Run

Your next task is to run the script for the first time to confirm that it can post to your Facebook Page. Here are the steps you will follow tomorrow.

### Step 1: Add Your Secrets to the Script

*   Open the file `main.py` in a text editor.
*   At the top of the file, you will see these two lines:
    ```python
    PAGE_ID = "YOUR_PAGE_ID"
    PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN = "YOUR_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```
*   Replace `YOUR_PAGE_ID` with the Page ID you saved: `717719538097140`.
*   Replace `YOUR_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the final, long Page Access Token that you saved.
*   Save the `main.py` file.

### Step 2: Install the Python Libraries

*   Open the command prompt (you can search for `cmd` in the Windows Start Menu).
*   In the command prompt, type the following command and press Enter to navigate to our project folder:
    ```bash
    cd "C:\Users\HP Laptop\Downloads\my business app\earning"
    ```
*   Now, type the following command and press Enter to install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Step 3: Run the Bot!

*   After the installation is finished, in that same command prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

This command will execute the script. It will connect to your Google Sheet, read the very first word, generate a random question, and post it to your Facebook Page. If the post appears on your page, the project is a complete success.
