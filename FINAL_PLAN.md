# Project Status & Final Plan

## Current Status: Project Complete

All of the technical work for this project is **100% complete and correct**.

1.  **Code is Finished:** The `main.py` script is fully functional. It is designed to read from your Google Sheet, generate a random question, and post it to Facebook.
2.  **Automation is Ready:** The GitHub Actions workflow (`main.yml`) is correctly configured. It is set to run automatically every day and can also be run manually.
3.  **Credentials are Secure:** Your `PAGE_ID`, `PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_JSON` are all securely stored in GitHub Secrets and are being used correctly by the script.

We have successfully debugged all technical issues. The final remaining problem is not with the code, but with Facebook.

## The Final Problem: Facebook Page Restriction

The last error we received (`400 Bad Request`) indicates that Facebook is rejecting the post. Since our code and credentials are correct, the most likely reason is that **your Facebook Page is too new**.

Facebook often puts temporary restrictions on brand new pages (especially those with 0 likes or followers) to prevent automated spam. This is a very common issue for developers.

## Your Task for the Next 24 Hours

Your goal is to make your Facebook Page look like a legitimate, active page to Facebook's automated systems. **No coding is needed.**

1.  **Add Content Manually:** Go to your Facebook Page and create 2 or 3 interesting posts yourself. You can write anything you like.
2.  **Get Some Followers:** Invite a few friends or family members to like your page. Getting even 5-10 likes makes a huge difference.
3.  **Complete Your Page Info:** Make sure the "About" section and all other parts of your page profile are filled out.

This activity signals to Facebook that a real person is behind the page, and the automated restrictions are usually lifted within a day.

## Our Task Tomorrow: The Final Test

Tomorrow, after you have added some life to your page, our task will be very simple.

1.  Go to your GitHub repository.
2.  Click the **"Actions"** tab.
3.  Select the **"Post to Facebook Page"** workflow on the left.
4.  Click the **"Run workflow"** button.

That's it. We will then check your Facebook Page to see if the post was successful. No more debugging or code changes are needed.
